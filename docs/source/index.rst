Welcome to pyLOM's documentation
==============================

**pyLOM** is a Python library for low-order modeling techniques.
This tool is a port of the POD/DMD of the tools from UPM in MATLAB to C/C++ using a python interface. So far POD, DMD and sPOD are fully implemented and work is being done to bring hoDMD and VAEs inside the tool. Please check the wiki for instructions on how to deploy the tool.
